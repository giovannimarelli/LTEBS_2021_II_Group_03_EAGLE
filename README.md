Laboratorio di Tecnologie Elettroniche e Biosensori S2021-II Group 03 EAGLE

In the Library folder, inside the Group_03_Library file we have inserted only the two additional devices we were required to make; other devices referred to Sparkfun and CY8CIT
Libraries were not included, supposing to be in your possess. 
For what regards the TMUX device we built the UQFN package, as specified by the description table inside the PDF, even if inside the provided schematic pins followed the 
TSSOP pattern. The same applies for the CY8CKIT059-TARGET: the table said to pick this, whereas inside the schematic the one used was the CY8CKIT059-TARGET_3: as before, we 
followed the table specs.

Inside the .brd file, Power Jack device looks like it exits the pcb: we intentionally placed it there folowing some examples online.
